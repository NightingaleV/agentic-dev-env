## Documentation structure (conventional)

We follow the *Diátaxis* style split. The /docs/examples/ folder contains practical examples and code-based tutorials. It also contains code snippets that may be referenced in other documentation. So all code in the docs/examples/ folder should be kept clean, well-documented, and easy to understand even for new user.

- **Tutorials** (`docs/tutorials/`): learning-oriented, step-by-step, “do this then that”. Serves as getting started section and onboarding. Can link to how-to guides for specific tasks. Assumes nothing, includes commands/output, tiny dataset, happy path only.
- **How-to guides** (`docs/how-to/`): task-oriented, goal-driven, examples assumes basic familiarity.
