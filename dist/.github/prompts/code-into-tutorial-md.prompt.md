Transform this Python script into a polished, beginner-friendly tutorial by refactoring the code, adding clear instructional comments, and generating a complete markdown tutorial. 
## Refactor the code  
   - Apply standard Python best practices  
   - Ensure code follows the PEP 8 style guide  
   - Rename unclear variables and functions if needed for clarity

## Add comments throughout the code  
   - Use a beginner-friendly, instructional tone  
   - Explain what each part of the code is doing and why it's important  
   - Focus on the logic and reasoning, not just syntax  
   - Avoid redundant or superficial comments
   - Add example inputs/outputs where relevant. So you probably should run the code, print important variables to see the outputs, so you can add them to comments.

## Goal: **Generate a tutorial as a `.md` file**  
   Include the following sections:
   - **Overview:** What the script does and why it's useful  
   - **Setup Instructions:** Prerequisites, dependencies, and how to run the script  
   - **How It Works:** A breakdown of the code logic based on the comments  
   - **Example Usage:** A code snippet showing how to use it  
   - **Sample Output:** (Optional) Include if the script returns visible results  

## Formatting Guidelines
- Use proper markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, and emphasis.
- Use mkdocs material syntax for admonitions (like `!!! note`, `!!! warning`) where appropriate.
- Use content tabs if there are multiple related code examples or explanations to organize the content better. (`=== "Tab Title"`)
